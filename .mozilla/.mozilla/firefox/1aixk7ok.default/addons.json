The add-on is supported by over forty filter subscriptions in dozens of languages which automatically configure it for purposes ranging from removing online advertising to blocking all known malware domains. Adblock Plus also allows you to customize your filters with the assistance of a variety of useful features, including a context option for images, a block tab for Flash and Java objects, and a list of blockable items to remove scripts and stylesheets.\n\nStarting with Adblock Plus 2.0 there is an option in Filter Preferences to allow some non-intrusive advertising. The goal is to support websites using non-intrusive ways to advertise and to encourage more websites to do the same.

Icons are also visible next to links in social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, as well as other popular sites like Wikipedia. By clicking the traffic light icon you can find out more information about a website’s reputation and other users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about potential threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.\n\nWOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other technical threats that you might encounter.\n\nYou can share your experiences by rating sites yourself and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.\n\nWOT has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.\n\nDownload WOT for your browser today!\nLearn more from mywot.com.","developerComments":"Please don't use reviews as a support forum.

You can block sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm). You can also set a password for access to the extension options, just to slow you down in moments of weakness!\n\nThe sites to block can be specified using wildcards (e.g., *.somesite.com) and exceptions (e.g., +allowme.somesite.com).\n\nLeechBlock also keeps track of the total amount of time you have spent browsing the sites in each block set.\n\nFor more information and the latest version, go to: http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html\n\nFor usage examples, go to: http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock_examples.html\n\nFor answers to frequently asked questions, go to: http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock_faq.html\n\nFor community support, go to: http://leechblock.freeforums.org","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68560.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68560.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"LeechBlock"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68561.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"648","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68561.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"LeechBlock Options (What to Block)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68562.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"648","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68562.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"LeechBlock Options (When to Block)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68563.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"648","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68563.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"LeechBlock Options (How to Block)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68564.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"648","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68564.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"LeechBlock Options (Access Control)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68565.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"648","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68565.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"LeechBlock Options (General)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68566.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","width":"296","height":"313","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68566.png?src=api&modified=1331346660","thumbnailWidth":"141","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"LeechBlock  Lockdown"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/290438/leechblock-0.6.7-fx.xpi?src=api","size":72412,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$5.00","developerComments":"Please check the FAQ page, examples page, and community support forum before emailing support queries to the developer.
